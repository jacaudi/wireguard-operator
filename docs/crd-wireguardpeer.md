# `WireguardPeer` reference

A client of a [`Wireguard`](crd-wireguard.md) server, identified by its public key. The operator
allocates the peer an address and the server's agent adds it to `wg0`. **Namespaced**, group
`vpn.wireguard-operator.io`, version `v1alpha1`, no short name. `kubectl get wireguardpeer` prints
`STATUS` (`.status.status`) and `AGE`.

Source of truth: [`api/v1alpha1/wireguardpeer_types.go`](../api/v1alpha1/wireguardpeer_types.go).
See [`examples/02-peer.yaml`](../examples/02-peer.yaml).

## Spec

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wireguardRef` | string | — | **Required**, minimum length 1. The name of the `Wireguard` this peer belongs to, in the peer's own namespace. |
| `publicKey` | string | — | The peer's WireGuard public key, as printed by `wg pubkey`. Validated at admission as a canonical 32-byte base64 WireGuard key. To register a peer without a key, omit the field: an explicit `""` is rejected. Without a key the peer gets no address and the server does not admit it. |

> **The private key never enters the cluster.** Generate the key pair where the client runs and
> register only the public half. The operator neither mints, stores nor reads a peer private key.

## Status (operator-written)

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `status` | `pending`, `ready` or `error`. |
| `message` | Why the peer is in that state. See the table below. |
| `address` | The peer's IPv4 tunnel address, without a prefix length, allocated by the operator from the server's `peerCIDR`. The server routes `<address>/32` to this peer. Released when the peer loses its key, and re-allocated when it is not a usable host address inside the server's `peerCIDR`. |
| `conditions` | Standard `metav1.Condition` list, keyed by `type`. Empty for a healthy peer. |

What each state means:

| `status` | `message` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `pending` | `Waiting for spec.publicKey` | No `publicKey`; see `PublicKeyMissing` below. |
| `error` | `spec.publicKey is not a valid WireGuard key` | The stored key is not a canonical WireGuard key; see `InvalidPublicKey` below. |
| `pending` | `Waiting for wireguard resource '<ref>' to be created` | No `Wireguard` named `wireguardRef` exists in this namespace. |
| `pending` | `Address <ip> is held by peer <name>; waiting for a new address` | Another peer of the same server holds this peer's address and wins the dedupe (oldest `creationTimestamp`, smaller name on a tie); see `AddressConflict` below. |
| `pending` | `No free address in <peerCIDR>` | The server's `peerCIDR` has no free address left. |
| `ready` | `Peer configured` | The peer is admitted with an address. The server's agent picks it up from the next `state.json` write. |

## Conditions

`Ready` is written only as `False`. The operator removes it once the peer is admitted.

| Type | Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Ready=False` | `PublicKeyMissing` | `spec.publicKey` is empty, so the server cannot admit this peer. |
| `Ready=False` | `InvalidPublicKey` | `spec.publicKey` is not a base64-encoded 32-byte WireGuard key, so the server cannot admit this peer. |
| `Ready=False` | `WireguardNotFound` | No `Wireguard` named `wireguardRef` exists in the peer's namespace. |
| `Ready=False` | `AddressConflict` | Another peer holds this peer's address and is the one that wins the dedupe (oldest `creationTimestamp`, smaller name on a tie). The peer gives its address up and is allocated a new one. |
| `Ready=False` | `AddressPoolExhausted` | The server's `peerCIDR` has no free address for this peer. The server stays `ready` and keeps serving the peers that hold addresses. |

## Lifecycle notes

- **Same namespace only.** `wireguardRef` resolves in the peer's own namespace; a peer cannot
  attach to a server elsewhere.
- **The server finds its peers by `wireguardRef`.** Peers created by this operator version carry no
  ownerReference to their `Wireguard` and are not deleted with it. Peers created by an earlier
  version keep theirs. Deleting the server leaves peers created by this version in place, reading
  `pending` with `WireguardNotFound`.
- **Deleting a peer removes it from `wg0`.** The operator drops it from `state.json`, and the
  agent removes any device peer whose key is no longer listed.
- **One address, one peer.** If two peers of one server end up with the same
  `status.address`, the peer with the oldest `creationTimestamp` keeps it. Ties go to the smaller
  name. The other peer reads `AddressConflict` and is allocated a new address.
- **A malformed `publicKey` is rejected at admission.** The API refuses a key that is not a
  canonical 32-byte base64 WireGuard key, so it cannot stall the server. A key stored before that
  check reports `InvalidPublicKey` and is left out of the server's state.
- **Clusters without CRD validation ratcheting.** Kubernetes before 1.30, or with the feature gate
  off, validates the whole object on every write. There, a peer stored with a `publicKey` that
  predates the pattern cannot have its status written. The operator logs an error on every
  reconcile and leaves the peer out of the server's state, but the peer keeps its old status, and
  its old `status.address` is not reserved, so another peer can be given it. Fix it by deleting the
  peer, or by setting a canonical key.
