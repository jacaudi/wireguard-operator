# wireguard-operator documentation

A Kubernetes operator that runs a WireGuard server inside your cluster and admits pods to it by
public key, declaratively — the base of an in-cluster VPN gateway that egresses through gluetun.

New here? Start with the [Quick start in the root README](../README.md#quick-start), then dig in:

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Installation](installation.md) | Prerequisites, install from source, your own images, manager flags, uninstall |
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | The two-resource model, the server pod, identity and addresses, what is out of scope |
| [`Wireguard` reference](crd-wireguard.md) | Server CRD: spec, status, conditions, owned objects, lifecycle |
| [`WireguardPeer` reference](crd-wireguardpeer.md) | Peer CRD: spec, status, conditions, lifecycle |
| [Gluetun egress](gluetun-egress.md) | Server egress through a gluetun sidecar — **designed, not yet implemented** |
| [Client sidecar](client-sidecar.md) | In-pod WireGuard client — **designed, not yet implemented** |
| [Upgrading from upstream](upgrading-from-upstream.md) | What this fork removed from jodevsa/wireguard-operator and what to do instead |
| [Examples](../examples/) | Runnable sample manifests |

## What's implemented

- **`Wireguard`** reconcile — server key Secret, single-replica server Deployment, ClusterIP
  Service on UDP `51820`, all applied with Server-Side Apply and garbage-collected with the CR.
- **`WireguardPeer`** registration — address allocation from `peerCIDR`, `PublicKeyMissing`
  reporting, duplicate-address reporting, ownership by the `Wireguard`.
- **Agent** — kernel WireGuard with a wireguard-go fallback; adds, updates and removes peers by
  public key as `state.json` changes; `/health` readiness.

## Not yet implemented (designed)

- **Egress through gluetun** — see [gluetun-egress.md](gluetun-egress.md). Tracked in
  [#3](https://github.com/jacaudi/wireguard-operator/issues/3).
- **Client sidecar** — see [client-sidecar.md](client-sidecar.md). Tracked in
  [#32](https://github.com/jacaudi/wireguard-operator/issues/32).
- **Peer validation** — a malformed `publicKey` is accepted by the API today (see
  [crd-wireguardpeer.md](crd-wireguardpeer.md#lifecycle-notes)). Tracked in
  [#37](https://github.com/jacaudi/wireguard-operator/issues/37).
- **OCI Helm chart** — see [installation.md](installation.md#install-with-helm-oci). Tracked in
  [#48](https://github.com/jacaudi/wireguard-operator/issues/48).

The design specs and implementation plans are working documents kept outside this repository, so
the issue threads are where design intent gets shared.
