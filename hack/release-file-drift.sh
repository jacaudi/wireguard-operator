# Assert the committed release.yaml still matches what config/ renders to.
#
# release.yaml is this repo's documented install path — users apply it straight
# from a tag — and it is a GENERATED file: `make generate-release-file` renders
# it with kustomize from config/default. So it can silently fall behind the CRDs,
# RBAC and Deployment it is supposed to ship, and nothing would say so until
# someone installed a stale manifest.
#
# This regenerates and FAILS on any diff. It never fixes the tree: a CI step that
# mutates what it is checking hides the problem it exists to surface. Same
# contract as the codegen gate in ci-lint.yml, and as scripts/chart-drift.sh for
# repos that ship a chart.
#
# WHY THE IMAGE PINS ARE READ BACK OUT OF THE FILE rather than passed in:
# generate-release-file bakes an image:tag into the output, and its Makefile
# defaults are the local dev values (agent:dev / manager:dev). Regenerating with
# those would report drift on every single run. The committed pins are also
# release-scoped — they name the version last released, which a push to a branch
# has no way to know and must not "correct". So this gate checks the STRUCTURE
# (CRDs, RBAC, Deployment shape) against config/, holding the pins fixed at
# whatever is committed. Bumping them is release-time work, not gate work.
