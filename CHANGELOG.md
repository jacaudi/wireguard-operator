# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-07)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **deps:** the minimum supported Kubernetes version is now 1.34, with the MutatingAdmissionPolicy beta enabled on 1.34 and 1.35 (--feature-gates=MutatingAdmissionPolicy=true and --runtime-config=admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1=true).
* **api:** Wireguard now requires spec.localCIDRs (at least one IPv4 CIDR) and spec.gluetun; a Wireguard with spec: {} is rejected by the CRD.
* **api:** a publicKey that is not a canonical 32-byte base64 WireGuard key is now rejected at admission, and a peerCIDR with host bits set, an IPv6 prefix or a prefix longer than /30 now reports Degraded/InvalidPeerCIDR instead of being used.
* **api:** WireguardPeer spec.address is removed. Existing peers are allocated afresh into status.address, so a peer's address can change once on upgrade.
* **controller:** WireguardPeers are no longer given an ownerReference to their Wireguard, so deleting a Wireguard no longer deletes its peers. The pending 'Waiting for wireguard peer to be created', the 'Waiting for <wireguard> to be ready' and the 'Duplicate address' peer statuses are gone. A peer whose Wireguard does not exist now reads pending instead of error.
* spec.useWgUserspaceImplementation, spec.enableIpForwardOnPodInit and the agent flag --wg-use-userspace-implementation are removed; the server pod always runs a privileged sysctl init container.
* spec.serviceType, spec.port, spec.address, spec.externalAddress, spec.serviceAnnotations, status.address, status.port, status.uniqueIdentifier and status.resources are removed; `<name>-svc` is always ClusterIP.
* spec.mtu, spec.dns, spec.dnsSearchDomain, spec.persistentKeepalive, status.dns and WireguardPeer spec.privateKeyRef, allowedIPs, dns and dnsSearchDomain are removed; the `<name>-peer-configs` and `<peer>-peer` Secrets are no longer written; peers must supply spec.publicKey.
* spec.peerCIDRv6, spec.ipv6Only and WireguardPeer spec.addressV6, disabled, egressNetworkPolicies, downloadSpeed and uploadSpeed are removed.
* spec.tunnel, status.tunnel and the wstunnel sidecar and Service port are removed.
* spec.metric, the `<name>-metrics-svc` Service and the agent's :9586 metrics port are removed.
* **agent:** the server no longer NATs peer traffic or enforces per-peer egress policy, so peers have no internet egress until M4 routes it through gluetun.

### Features

* add PersistentKeepalive to generated peer configs ([f3de393](https://github.com/jacaudi/wireguard-operator/commit/f3de393c6ab845025cb2b2e819dc97d69e306a06)), closes [#4](https://github.com/jacaudi/wireguard-operator/issues/4)
