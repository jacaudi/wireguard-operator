// FieldManager identifies this operator's Server-Side Apply field manager. It is part of the
// on-cluster contract: changing it orphans field ownership on every existing object and leaves
// stale entries in managedFields. Not a tunable.
const FieldManager = "wireguard-operator"

// legacyFieldManagers names the Update-operation field manager that owns every field of an
// object written by this operator before it used Server-Side Apply. The apiserver takes the
// manager name from the client's User-Agent, whose first segment is the binary name: the image
// runs /manager (images/manager/Dockerfile) and cmd/manager sets no custom User-Agent, so it is
// "manager". Part of the on-cluster contract, like FieldManager. Objects last written by a
// differently named binary, such as a `go run` dev build, are not migrated.
var legacyFieldManagers = sets.New("manager")

// applyOwned renders an operator-owned object into the cluster with Server-Side Apply. The
// apiserver performs the diff; there is deliberately no client-side comparison. obj is
// overwritten with the server's response, so each call needs a freshly built object.
//
// What the operator ends up owning is what json.Marshal of the built object emits, which is not
// the same as "the fields the builder sets", in either direction. Zero-valued structs are emitted
// despite omitempty -- so the operator owns spec.strategy, the agent container's resources, and
// the pod template's creationTimestamp, none of which any builder sets. Zero-valued scalars with
// omitempty are dropped -- so a nodePort of 0 is not owned, which is what lets the apiserver keep
// its own allocation.
//
// ForceOwnership is unconditional. A conflict is only raised when the applied value differs from
// a value owned by another manager, so the first apply over an object previously written by
// Create/Update succeeds without it -- but the first apply that actually changes such a field
// would fail, and the operator would wedge. Forcing is also what makes the operator converge an
// object a human edited with kubectl.
//
// Forcing alone does not finish adoption. It transfers only the fields whose value differs, so
// the legacy manager keeps every field the operator renders unchanged, and the apiserver never
// prunes a field another manager still owns: stop rendering one -- the wstunnel sidecar, a
// toleration, a service annotation -- and it stays. So before applying to an object that already
// exists, the legacy manager's fields are merged into FieldManager's apply entry
// (csaupgrade.UpgradeManagedFieldsPatch). That costs one extra write per legacy object, once;
// on every later call the computed patch is nil and nothing is sent. The patch pins the
// resourceVersion that was read, so a stale cache read fails with a conflict and is retried on
// the next reconcile rather than overwriting newer managedFields.
//
// SSA requires apiVersion and kind in the request body, and a typed object's TypeMeta is empty
// after construction, so the GVK is derived from the scheme and stamped on before the call.
// Without this the apiserver rejects the patch with "invalid object type: /, Kind=".
